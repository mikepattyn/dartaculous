## until mongo_dart upgrades its depedencies to ration: 2.0.0, we cannot test with the latest version 
## of map_mapper_generator

## We need to consider implementing a mongodb driver over RestHeart (Rest API for Dart) instead of 
## depending on mongo_dart. With RestHeart we will get MongoDB transaction support.
