This package assists communicating with FFI built packages under the same process, but leveraging protocol buffers as the serialization protocol to communicate between Dart and the target package.

It assumes the packages are developed in GO, using the [GO Dart bridge package](https://pkg.go.dev/gitlab.com/go_framework/dart_bridge).
