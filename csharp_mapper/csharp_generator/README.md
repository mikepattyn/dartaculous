## Introduction

The purpose of this package, alongside its companion csharp_annotations package, is to generate equivalent C# classes to the mapped Dart classes.

This is pretty much alpha. It does basic mapping, but many features and documentation are still missing.

## Context

This package is part of a set of loosely integrated packages that constitute the [Dartaculous Framework](https://gitlab.com/dartaculous/dartaculous#squarealfa-dart-framework).
